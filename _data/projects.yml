- title: Customer query classification system (NLP, MLOps)
  year: 2025
  tags: [Machine Learning, NLP, Text Classification, MLOps, FastAPI, Industry]
  link: https://github.com/LuisFMCuriel/Ryanair_classifier
  description: >
    Designed and deployed a multi-class NLP system to automatically classify customer
    support queries into operational categories (e.g. flight changes, account issues,
    mobile app issues).
    Implemented a TF-IDF + Logistic Regression pipeline with class balancing,
    achieving ~99% accuracy and strong per-class F1 scores on an imbalanced dataset.
    The model was deployed as a FastAPI service with real-time and batch inference
    endpoints, model versioning, and production-ready MLOps considerations
    (containerization, reproducibility, and CI/CD readiness).
